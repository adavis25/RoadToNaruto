# Mod Overview
To start off this will be a quick overview of the plans for the mod that we can change at anytime. 
## Questing
I want do do the quests in this using Better Questing (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-questing)


This mod adds in a questbook that I believe you can use and edit to suit your needs. So there would be a couple sections of ours. 
* Main Quest (Optional Idea)
* Village Quests
  * In village quests the village you choose would have a questline in it for things to do around the village including
    * Village Questline
    * Village Radiant Quests
    * Village Rewards Shop
    * Village Jutsu Shop
    * Village Challenges
  * These quests will reward you with Ryo, and Reputation that you get to spend In the shops around the village and in the rewards shop
  * Jutsu masters around the village will also be able to teach you their signature jutsus for a ammount of reputation and maybe even their side quests. 
* Clan Quests
  * In clan quests you can do Quests from your clan to learn about the clan and its jutsus
  * In clan quests youll have
    * The Clan Questline
    * The Clan Jutsu unlocker
    * Clan Specific Trainers
    * Clan Side Quests
    * Clan Rewards Shop
    * Clan Challenges
* Bingo book
  * I want to try and emplement a bingo book, not sure how easy this will be but there would//could be a list of rouge ninjas on there that every so often you can go and try to capture and claim a reward on.  I want to try and roatate the ninja in the bingo book after the entire book is finished but havent really thought of a way to implement this yet.  
* Side Quests
  * In here would be plenty of sidequests that may or may not be hidden depending if you have met the requirements  or the npc in the world. These rewards could vary from pretty much anything and more can get added or removed as the world progresses. 

## Rewards and Unlocks
The way to deal with ryo that I want to emplement I want to try to do in better questing, so all of your money is not clogging your inventory space so you could go in to the shop to buy items and such.  As for Jutsu unlocks all jutsu would be unlocked inside this menu, where you have requirements for them and such.  Using reputation points to unlock the jutsu. 

## Skills
Instead of the old way of leveling up jut mob grinding and hitting max level in one day to avoid this there will be skills that you actually have to train to get them leveled up. Not sure if I even want to have levels but instead just having skills that you use and level up from there, Kind of like skyrim and other RPG games.  There will also be skill trainers for clans villages hidden trainers etc etc that can help train your skills for a fee or for a quest.  
* The Current list of skills I want to have
  * Ninjutsu
  * Genjutsu
  * Taijutsu
  * Shurikenjutsu
  *
